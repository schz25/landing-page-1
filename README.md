<h1>This is the first draft of my landing page for a project for the Odin Project.</h1>
<h2>I have learned a lot during this first part of the project and there are some improvements that still need to be made.</h2>
<h3>These are some of the things I have added so far: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Responsive Nav Bar</li>
  <li>Intro Section</li>
</ul>
<h3>These are some of the things I still need to add and improve on the existing project: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>The intro section needs to have the text on top of the description text.</li>
  <li>There will be an additional information section added below the intro section</li>
  <li>The information section will also have a quote box with a different background color and italic text</li>
  <li>There will also be a footer added to the bottom of the page</li>
</ul>
<h1>The second commit was a little more challenging than expected</h1>
<h2>Difficulties: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Trying to position the intro image to the right of the screen</li>
  <li>Making the h1 of the intro lowered on the page and having the p underneath it</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I have learned</h2>
<p>This project has taught me a lot about using flexbox and the grid as well. The styling is always difficult
  but this has taught me to try out different methods when the style is not living up to expectation.</p>
